"""Putting facts into a grid.

Every table is the same operation: say which row and which column each fact belongs to, put it
there, and drop the rows nothing landed in. What differs is only what a row or a column *is*: a
concept, a member of an explicit dimension, the text of a typed dimension, or a combination of
dimension values. ``GridBuilder`` has one method per kind, each a few lines over ``_place`` and
``_matrix``.
